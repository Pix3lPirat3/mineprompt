[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » Keyboard key
[Nomad] xtmc » just place it back on
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » I do not have that type of keyboard
[Nomad] xtmc » i did that with a school keyboard
[Nomad] xtmc » membrane keyboard
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » thi a laptop
[Nomad] xtmc » ah...
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » you can probably tell what key I don&#39;t have
[Nomad] xtmc » try putting it back
[Nomad] xtmc » if it doesn&#39;t work you might have to get an external keyboard or take it to a specialist
[Nomad] xtmc » wb
[VIP] TykEight » ty
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » ok I think its fine
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » it was the S key
[Nomad] xtmc » did it pop back in?
[Nomad] xtmc » oh shit that&#39;s one of the worst keys to lose in mc
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » It did but you had to press really hard to do so
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » I can&#39;t press hard enough to say the least
[Nomad] xtmc » yeah i told you to try popping it back in
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » Literally my father had to do it
[Nomad] xtmc » haha
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » but I kinda doubt that it will pop out again at to some point
[Nomad] xtmc » your father just saved you like 10 dollars and some space
[Nomad] xtmc » i mean you can always buy a separate keyboard
[Nomad] xtmc » F
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » Uh we use laptops in this house
[Nomad] xtmc » i know
[Nomad] xtmc » you can buy a keyboard and plug it into your laptop
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » mainly because we gotta take it somewhere
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » and I don&#39;t think were willing to pay for keyboards
[Nomad] xtmc » welcome back
[Nomad] xtmc » aight then
[Budgie] ImShadowBomber » thx
[Nomad] xtmc » just ask me if you want a good keyboard, i&#39;m pretty much always here
[Budgie] GamingBryan1 » I am from the Skygrid section of this server
[VIP] TykEight » are you trying to trade keys?
[VIP] TykEight » well then
[Nomad] xtmc » the moment you said that...
[VIP] TykEight » i assumed
[Nomad] xtmc » it was a fair assumption
[VIP] TykEight » yalllong as u have logged into each server (not vanilla obv) u will get keys there too when u vote
[VIP] TykEight » typing hard
[Nomad] xtmc » xd
[VIP] TykEight » but ye, its worth logging in to all at least once so u can trade keys
[Nomad] xtmc » done
[VIP] TykEight » nice
[VIP] TykEight » from now on u will get em on all
[Nomad] xtmc » btw is there a backstory for the &quot;we don not condone or recommend communism&quot; remark?
[VIP] TykEight » there is, its kinda lame but on all the other servers u can &#x2F;communism {amount} and it pays every player online that amount
[Nomad] xtmc » xd
[VIP] TykEight » there is more of a backstory but not 100% aware of it
[Nomad] xtmc » i just calculated some the drop odds in the spawner crate
[Nomad] xtmc » the odds total at 95%
[Nomad] xtmc » i&#39;m assuming the cow spawner drop rate is actually 10% not 5%
[VIP] TykEight » not sure tbh, but out of all the animals cow is best, and so seems rarer
[Nomad] xtmc » yeah there has to be a slight error
[VIP] TykEight » yeah maybe
[Nomad] xtmc » because the total odds ended up being 95% not 100%
[VIP] TykEight » yeah it does...
[Nomad] xtmc » as a league of legends player, i blame riot
[VIP] TykEight » the prem crate is correct
[Nomad] xtmc » yeah ofc you can get a sharp 10 sword
[VIP] TykEight » maybe they removed a spawner and forgot to update it
[Nomad] xtmc » which?
[Nomad] xtmc » squid?
[VIP] TykEight » mm squid is in rare, so maybe witch
[Nomad] xtmc » ...
[Nomad] xtmc » witch spawners?
[VIP] TykEight » there used to be witch on survival servers here long time ago
[Nomad] xtmc » weba
[VIP] TykEight » wb
[God] Blom » ty
[Nomad] xtmc » do you drop your items if you die in a bossfight?
[VIP] TykEight » not in god but yes to others
[VIP] TykEight » unless u have keepinv
[Nomad] xtmc » ah
[Nomad] xtmc » btw there are 2 vip ranks
[Nomad] xtmc » one for 5 aud and the other for 15
[Nomad] xtmc » what&#39;s the difference?
[VIP] TykEight » the keepinv u mean?
[Nomad] xtmc » vip rank
[Nomad] xtmc »  
[VIP] TykEight » one is 1 month, 1 is forever i think?
[VIP] TykEight » vip dont give u keepinv tho
[Nomad] xtmc » ah
[VIP] TykEight » it basically lets u silk your spawners and &#x2F;nick yourself
[Nomad] xtmc » that&#39;s it?
[VIP] TykEight » u can get 48hr vip&#39;s in game
[Nomad] xtmc » thought it would offer much better perks
[VIP] TykEight » do &#x2F;vip
[VIP] TykEight » to see what u get
[Nomad] xtmc » .&#x2F;back is useful
[VIP] TykEight » most of them u unlock with ranks
[VIP] TykEight » it is usually, but a little janky here
[VIP] TykEight » cos of island perms
[VIP] TykEight » u dont always go back to where u think u will
[Nomad] xtmc » bruh
[Nomad] xtmc » and what does &#x2F;condense do?
[VIP] TykEight » turns gems into blocks
[VIP] TykEight » in ur inv
[Nomad] xtmc » so pretty much useless
[VIP] TykEight » handy for goldfarm
[Nomad] xtmc » oh right gold farms
[VIP] TykEight » and if u mining at the warps, to clear your inv a little
[Nomad] xtmc » nvm you get rare keys when voting
[Nomad] xtmc » and an extra point
[VIP] TykEight » oh yeah that too
[VIP] TykEight » sorry
[VIP] TykEight » so u get 6 + 1 rare
[Nomad] xtmc » just 1 rare? thought it was 6 rare
[VIP] TykEight » nah
[Nomad] xtmc » i guess this server isn&#39;t as p2w as i thought it was excluding the spawner and premium buys
[VIP] TykEight » the normal 6, so they can be anything, then 1 extra guaranteed rare
[VIP] TykEight » yeah it isnt as p2w on here as the survival servers here
[VIP] TykEight » different player base i think
[Nomad] xtmc » now i don&#39;t even wanna know...
[VIP] TykEight » seems older average base here
[VIP] TykEight » less 10yo&#39;s
[Nomad] xtmc » 17 here
